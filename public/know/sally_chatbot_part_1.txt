\f3\b0 \'a0(key treatment for dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines around eyes), and the\'a0
\f2\b Resurfacing Face Oil
\f3\b0 \'a0(to nourish and brighten the skin, especially beneficial when applied around the eye area at night for extra moisture). Together, these three address both the general complexion and the delicate eye area.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Lighter, less noticeable under-eye circles, reduced puffiness, and smoother, hydrated skin around the eyes. The face oil in the kit also helps give a subtle glow, so the entire face looks well-rested.

\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++
\f3\b0 \'a0(to prevent UV from darkening the hyperpigmentation further \'96 absolutely critical in any de-pigmentation routine). Additionally, a rich night cream like\'a0
\f2\b Bio Placenta Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0could be included to support skin renewal overnight.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Gradual but significant fading of dark patches and discoloration, more uniform skin tone, and prevention of new pigmentation from forming. This kit is often recommended for those with sun damage or post-acne marks who are committed to a diligent routine (especially sun protection).\'a0
\f2\b De-Tan Removal Kit (Midnight Magic Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A kit focused on removing suntan and reversing sun damage. It usually features products that exfoliate the tanned, dead skin layer and brighten the fresh skin beneath. Common components might be\'a0
\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0or an AHA-based peel/serum (to lift away tanned cells),\'a0
\f2\b The Secret Glow Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0(to work magic overnight in repairing sun damage and adding glow), and\'a0
\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++

\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Reduced tan lines and patches, restoration of the skin\'92s natural color, and a brighter, more even skin tone overall. It essentially \'93erases\'94 the effects of sun exposure when used diligently over a few weeks. (Again, daily sunscreen is a non-negotiable part of detan routine, so this kit emphasizes that.)\'a0

\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0for a dose of vitamins and mild exfoliation; and the\'a0
\f2\b Resurfacing Face Oil
\f3\b0 \'a0to lock in moisture and impart a healthy glow. Another variant might swap in a light day cream or the sunscreen if it\'92s a daytime glow focus. The idea is to both brighten and nourish the skin so it naturally glows.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Immediately, a hydrated luminous finish (thanks to the face oil); and with continued use, improved tone and texture, and that elusive \'93lit from within\'94 glow. Think of it as a mini-regimen for special events or just maintaining a naturally radiant complexion.\'a0
