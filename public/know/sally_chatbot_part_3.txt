a plant-derived bio-placenta, not an animal one, making it vegan. A few products may use ingredients like honey or beeswax if at all, but currently our known formulations are largely plant-based.

Q: I\'92m new to skincare. What basic routine should I start with?
\f3\b0 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f2\b \cb3 A:
\f3\b0 \'a0Welcome to the world of skincare! A basic routine need not be complicated \'96 we usually recommend the\'a0
\f2\b CTM approach: Cleanse, Treat, Moisturize (and Protect)
\f3\b0 . In the morning: use a gentle\'a0
\f2\b cleanser
\f3\b0 \'a0to wash your face, then apply a\'a0
\f2\b moisturizer
\f3\b0 \'a0suited to your skin (this hydrates and balances your skin), and follow up with\'a0
\f2\b sunscreen
\f3\b0 \'a0(this is vital to protect from UV damage every day). At night: cleanse again to remove the day\'92s impurities (double cleanse if you wore makeup or sunscreen \'96 oil cleanser then regular cleanser), apply a\'a0
\f2\b treatment
\f3\b0 \'a0product if you have one (this could be a serum for your specific concern, like Acne Arrest for acne or Skin Secret Serum for brightening, but if you\'92re brand new you can even skip to start), and then moisturize to help your skin recover overnight. So the absolute basics: Cleanser \uc0\u8594  Moisturizer \u8594  Sunscreen (AM). Cleanser \u8594  Moisturizer (PM) is a fine start. As you get comfortable, you can introduce a treatment serum or night cream to target any issues you have. For instance, our\'a0
\f2\b Daily Essential Kit
\f3\b0 \'a0was created just for beginners \'96 it gives you the face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen, which cover those bases perfectly. Simplicity and consistency are key for newbies \'96 once you\'92ve got the habit down and your skin is used to it, we can guide you to add more steps if needed. And we\'92re always here to help choose products for your skin type once you\'92re ready to expand.\cb1 \
\ls5\ilvl0
\f2\b \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Q: In what order should I apply the products?
\f3\b0 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f2\b \cb3 A:
\f3\b0 \'a0A great question! The general rule of thumb is to apply products from\'a0
\f2\b thinnest to thickest
\f3\b0 \'a0consistency. After cleansing, if you use a toner, that would go first (since it\'92s like water). Next, apply your\'a0
\f2\b serums or treatment products
\f3\b0 \'a0\'96 these tend to be lightweight and you want them to penetrate (for example: first a water-like serum, then something a bit thicker). If you have multiple serums, apply the one targeting your main concern first (some people do, say, a Vitamin C serum then a Hyaluronic serum; or Niacinamide then Retinol at night, etc. \'96 but if you\'92re not sure, ask us and we\'92ll specify for your case). After serums, put on your\'a0
\f2\b eye cream/serum
\f3\b0 \'a0(since the eye area should be treated before heavier creams go on the rest of face). Then apply your\'a0
\f2\b moisturizer
\f3\b0 \'a0to seal everything in and hydrate. In the morning, the final step would be\'a0
\f2\b sunscreen
\f3\b0 \'a0\'96 always apply sunscreen last, after moisturizer, because it needs to form an even protective layer on top. Makeup, if any, would go on after the sunscreen has absorbed a bit (let sunscreen sit for 2-3 minutes before makeup). At night, you\'92d finish with moisturizer or a night cream. If you use a facial oil, it generally goes\'a0
\f4\i after
\f3\i0 \'a0moisturizer (since oils are thick and occlusive \'96 you put them on top to lock in moisture). Alternatively, you can mix a drop of oil into your moisturizer. So for example, a morning routine could be: Cleanser \uc0\u8594  (Toner) \u8594  Vitamin C Serum \u8594  Moisturizer \u8594  Sunscreen. An evening routine could be: Cleanser \u8594  (Toner) \u8594  Acne Serum (light) \u8594  Retinol Serum (a bit heavier) \u8594  Eye Serum \u8594  Night Cream \u8594  (Face Oil last). It might sound like a lot, but step-by-step it\'92s logical. If ever in doubt, remember:\'a0
\f2\b thin to thick
\f3\b0 , and\'a0
\f2\b sunscreen always last in daytime
\f3\b0 . Our chatbot can also help you sort out a specific order if you list what you have.\cb1 \

Q: How long does it take to see results from these products?
\f3\b0 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f2\b \cb3 A:
\f3\b0 \'a0Patience is key with skincare. You may see some immediate benefits \'96 for example, using the Foaming Face Wash will give your skin an instant clean, fresh feeling and perhaps a bit of glow from the first use, and a good moisturizer will plump up your skin in a day or two. But for specific concerns like acne, pigmentation, or wrinkles, it takes more time. Generally, we say\'a0
\f2\b give a new skincare routine about 4 to 6 weeks to start seeing noticeable improvements
\f3\b0 , because that\'92s roughly one skin cell turnover cycle. For acne, you might notice fewer new pimples in 2-4 weeks, but dark spots from old acne could take a couple of months to fade with consistent use of serums (and sunscreen!). For anti-aging benefits, fine lines might soften after 8-12 weeks of retinol use. Pigmentation and melasma often require 2-3 months of diligent care to see significant lightening. It also depends on the severity of the issue and using the products as directed (e.g., using that sunscreen every single day dramatically affects how fast your dark spots fade, since sun can darken them). So, while some effects (like hydration, a temporary \'93glow\'94) can be seen in days, the deeper changes (like smoothing wrinkles, clearing acne scarring) usually manifest over several weeks. Consistency is crucial \'96 stick with the routine, and you\'92ll reap the rewards. We encourage taking a \'93before\'94 photo so you can compare in a month or two; often changes are gradual and you realize\'a0
\f4\i \'93Oh wow, my skin really has improved!\'94
\f3\i0 \'a0when you look back. Of course, if something isn\'92t working for you after a fair trial, our team can tweak your regimen. But don\'92t give up too early \'96 good skin is a journey, and we\'92re with you on it.\cb1 \

Q: Are Sally\'92s Soul Therapy products suitable for men?
\f3\b0 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f2\b \cb3 A:
\f3\b0 \'a0Yes! In skincare,\'a0
\f2\b skin is skin
\f3\b0 \'a0\'96 our products are formulated for skin types and concerns, not a specific gender. In fact, many men are part of the Sally\'92s Soul Therapy family (our products are unisex and several have \'93for Men & Women\'94 on the label). Men\'92s skin can be a bit oilier and thicker on average due to testosterone, but that just means they too benefit from the cleansing, exfoliation, and hydration our line provides. For example, the Timeless Face Wash is excellent for men dealing with oily skin or post-gym sweat. The Acne Kit can help with shaving acne or ingrown hairs by keeping pores clear. Also, our SunShade SPF is matte \'96 something many men appreciate to avoid shine. We even have male clients who swear by the Resurfacing Face Oil to keep their beard area skin soft and the Intense Rejuvenating Night Cream to tackle fine lines. The textures of our products are generally lightweight and absorb quickly, which men often prefer. So there\'92s no stigma \'96 taking care of your skin is for everyone. We encourage men to have a basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen at least. If you\'92re a man unsure where to start, the Daily Essential Kit is a great option. And if you have a thick beard, don\'92t worry \'96 our serums and moisturizer can be worked into facial hair and will still reach the skin (or you can focus on non-beard areas and use a light oil to keep the beard hair conditioned). Bottom line: healthy, glowing skin has no gender, and we\'92re here to help guys put their best face forward too.\cb1 \

Q: I\'92m pregnant \'96 are these products safe to use during pregnancy?
\f3\b0 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 
\f2\b \cb3 A:
\f3\b0 \'a0Congratulations! Pregnancy is a time where you do have to be mindful of certain skincare ingredients. Many of our products are pregnancy-safe, but a few may contain ingredients that doctors often suggest avoiding during pregnancy (and nursing). For instance, products with\'a0
\f2\b high levels of retinoids (Retinol)
\f3\b0 \'a0are typically not recommended in pregnancy. Our Intense Skin Reversal Night Serum has retinol, so you\'92d pause that and any strong retinol creams. Also, high concentration salicylic acid or certain essential oils are sometimes cautioned against. However,\'a0
\f2\b most of our line is gentle and should be fine
\f3\b0 \'a0\'96 ingredients like niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, centella, etc., are generally regarded as safe for expecting mothers. Our Acne Arrest Serum has salicylic and glycolic; salicylic in topical form in small amounts (like in a face wash or spot treatment) is usually considered okay by many docs, but maybe avoid heavy use \'96 you can switch to a gentle alpha hydroxy acid or just stick to cleansing well to manage breakouts. The Brightening Serum (Skin Secret) mainly has acids like lactic, glycolic and tranexamic \'96 many ob/gyns consider those okay in moderation, but again, it\'92s good to confirm.\'a0
\f2\b We strongly advise consulting with your doctor
\f3\b0 \'a0with the ingredient lists of any product (we can provide full lists) to get personalized guidance, as every pregnancy is different and doctors have varying thresholds. As a quick guide: our\'a0
\f2\b Epidermal Obsession Moisturizer, SunShade SPF, Timeless Face Wash, Angel Eye Serum, Resurfacing Face Oil
\f3\b0 \'a0are all free of known harmful ingredients and are a-okay. Do continue to use sunscreen daily \'96 it\'92s extra important as pregnancy can bring melasma (the \'93mask of pregnancy\'94) and sun exposure makes it worse. Our SunShade, with its Vitamin C and high SPF, is a great choice since it both protects and helps fend off pigmentation. In summary, yes you can continue a routine, just simplify and avoid the stronger actives like retinol or high percentage peels unless cleared by your doctor. We\'92re happy to help identify which products to put on pause. Wishing you a healthy, glowing pregnancy \'96 you\'92ll be literally glowing, partly from hormones and partly from good skincare!\cb1 \

We\'92re very responsive on WhatsApp; in fact, many clients simply send a message like \'93Hi, I\'92d like to book a facial on Saturday\'94 and we handle it. Alternatively, through our Instagram (@sallyssoultherapy) and Facebook pages, there are booking links and you can DM us.

We recommend booking at least a few days in advance, especially for weekends, as slots can fill up \'96 Saliemaa is in high demand!

\f3\b0 \'a0personality that the brand is known for. When you interact with the bot, it will feel like chatting with a friendly, holistic skin therapist who genuinely cares about your well-being. Here\'92s what you can expect from the chatbot\'92s tone and style:\cb1 \

Your skin will improve, and I\'92m here to help you get there step by step.\'94 It celebrates users\'92 progress (\'93Yay!

Expert yet Accessible:
\f3\b0 \'a0The chatbot provides expert advice, backed by knowledge (as you\'92ve seen, it knows ingredients and routines in depth), but it explains things in simple terms. It avoids heavy jargon \'96 and when it does use a technical term, it briefly explains it. For instance, it won\'92t just say \'93use an AHA\'94; it will add \'93(an alpha hydroxy acid, which exfoliates the skin)\'94 so the user learns. The bot\'92s aim is to educate without ever condescending. It treats every question as valid, no matter how basic.

Holistic and Positive:
\f3\b0 \'a0The personality isn\'92t purely clinical. It brings a holistic vibe \'96 occasionally referencing that skincare is also about self-love and wellness. It might encourage good lifestyle habits if relevant (\'93Remember to drink water and get some rest \'96 they\'92re beauty ingredients too!\'94). It stays positive and uplifting.

It might say, \'93Let me ask, what is your skin type?\'94 or \'93Do you prefer a simple routine or are you open to multiple steps?\'94 to tailor advice. It\'92s never pushy in selling \'96 it suggests products when appropriate, but the vibe is \'93recommendation from a mentor\'94 not \'93sales pitch\'94.

It sets users\'92 minds at ease by conveying confidence in the process (\'93We can absolutely get your skin to a better place, it just takes consistency and the right care.\'94). It also builds trust by citing brief reasons or facts when giving advice (for example, mentioning an ingredient\'92s benefit or a policy detail, often with a gentle citation from the knowledge base if needed). The bot never guesses if it doesn\'92t know something \'96 instead, it will honestly admit if a question is outside its scope and will seek to guide the user to the right resource (like recommending a dermatologist for serious medical issues).
