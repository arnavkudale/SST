\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b0\fs24 \cf2 \cb3 The following\'a0
\f2\b Skincare Kits
\f3\b0 \'a0are curated sets of products sold together, targeting specific skin goals. Each kit provides a complete routine or multi-step regimen to address that particular concern.\'a0
\f2\b Acne Kit (Acne Care Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A comprehensive kit designed to combat acne breakouts and oily skin. It typically includes a cleanser, treatment serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen \'96 everything you need for a full acne-fighting routine. For example, the Acne Kit features the\'a0
\f2\b Timeless Skin Foaming Face Wash

\f3\b0 \'a0(light hydration that won\'92t clog pores), and\'a0
\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++

\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Reduced breakouts, less oily shine, minimized pores, and prevention of post-acne marks (since sunscreen is included).\'a0
\f2\b Anti-Ageing Kit (Night Trio Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A set focused on rejuvenating the skin and reducing signs of aging, especially meant for nighttime use (as the name\'a0
\f4\i \'93Night Trio\'94
\f3\i0 \'a0implies three steps at night). This kit usually combines a potent serum like the\'a0
\f2\b Intense Skin Reversal Retinol 2% Serum
\f3\b0 , a nourishing night cream (such as the\'a0
\f2\b Bio Placenta Anti-Ageing Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0or\'a0

\f3\b0 ), and a gentle cleanser or toner to prep the skin. By using the trio together, the skin gets exfoliated, repaired, and deeply moisturized overnight.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Smoother skin texture, diminished fine lines and wrinkles, improved firmness, and a youthful glow. Over time, users can see lifted, firmer skin and fading age spots.\'a0
\f4\i (If used in the daytime, this kit would also include sun protection, but primarily it\'92s meant for a nightly regimen.)
\f3\i0 \'a0
\f2\b Brightening Kit (The \'93Kiss Goodbye to Dullness\'94 Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A kit curated to banish dullness and uneven tone, giving the skin a luminous glow. It often contains the\'a0
\f2\b Timeless Skin Foaming Face Wash
\f3\b0 \'a0for daily exfoliation, the\'a0
\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0(rich in niacinamide, arbutin, etc. for targeting pigmentation and dull areas), and\'a0
\f2\b The Secret Glow Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0to revitalize the skin overnight. Some versions of the Brightening Kit may also include the\'a0
\f2\b Angel Eye Under Eye Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0to brighten the eye area, since overall radiance includes reducing dark circles.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0A more even complexion, reduction in dark spots or patchy pigmentation, and a healthy brightness to the skin. It\'92s great for those with sun dullness, pigmentation, or anyone whose skin looks tired or ashy, as it literally \'93kisses goodbye\'94 to dull skin.\'a0
\f2\b Daily Essential Kit (Skin Essential Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0This is a basic everyday skincare trio for maintaining healthy skin. It generally includes the three fundamental products everyone should use daily:\'a0
\f2\b Timeless Skin Foaming Face Wash
\f3\b0 \'a0(cleanser),\'a0
\f2\b Epidermal Obsession Moisturizer
\f3\b0 \'a0(moisturizing cream), and\'a0
\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++ Sunscreen
\f3\b0 \'a0(sun protection). This kit covers the essential morning routine steps \'96 cleansing, hydrating, and protecting \'96 suitable for all skin types.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0If used consistently, these essentials keep skin clean, soft, and protected from UV damage. It\'92s ideal for someone who is new to skincare or wants a simple regimen that addresses basic needs (clean skin, no dryness, no sunburn). This kit ensures your skin stays balanced and guarded against environmental stress.\'a0
\f2\b Dark Circle Kit (The Allure Around the Eye Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A targeted kit to specifically tackle dark under-eye circles and tired eyes. The Dark Circle Kit includes the\'a0
\f2\b Timeless Skin Foaming Face Wash
\f3\b0 \'a0(to keep the overall face clean and free of dullness), the\'a0
\f2\b Angel Eye Under Eye Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0(key treatment for dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines around eyes), and the\'a0
\f2\b Resurfacing Face Oil
\f3\b0 \'a0(to nourish and brighten the skin, especially beneficial when applied around the eye area at night for extra moisture). Together, these three address both the general complexion and the delicate eye area.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Lighter, less noticeable under-eye circles, reduced puffiness, and smoother, hydrated skin around the eyes. The face oil in the kit also helps give a subtle glow, so the entire face looks well-rested. It\'92s perfect for those dealing with late nights, genetics-related dark circles, or eye strain that shows on their face.\'a0
\f2\b De-Pigmentation Kit (Nocturnal Nourishment Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A heavy-duty pigmentation-correction kit intended to fade stubborn hyperpigmentation such as melasma, dark spots, or old acne marks. This kit likely combines exfoliation, skin-lightening actives, and nourishment. For instance, it may include\'a0
\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0(for its tranexamic acid, arbutin and niacinamide \'96 all great for pigment issues),\'a0
\f2\b Intense Skin Reversal Retinol Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0(to speed up cell turnover and lighten spots over time), and\'a0
\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++
\f3\b0 \'a0(to prevent UV from darkening the hyperpigmentation further \'96 absolutely critical in any de-pigmentation routine). Additionally, a rich night cream like\'a0
\f2\b Bio Placenta Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0could be included to support skin renewal overnight.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Gradual but significant fading of dark patches and discoloration, more uniform skin tone, and prevention of new pigmentation from forming. This kit is often recommended for those with sun damage or post-acne marks who are committed to a diligent routine (especially sun protection).\'a0
\f2\b De-Tan Removal Kit (Midnight Magic Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A kit focused on removing suntan and reversing sun damage. It usually features products that exfoliate the tanned, dead skin layer and brighten the fresh skin beneath. Common components might be\'a0
\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0or an AHA-based peel/serum (to lift away tanned cells),\'a0
\f2\b The Secret Glow Night Cream
\f3\b0 \'a0(to work magic overnight in repairing sun damage and adding glow), and\'a0
\f2\b SunShade SPF 50++
\f3\b0 \'a0(to halt further tanning and protect the new skin). By using this kit, someone who has developed uneven skin tone or darker complexion from sun exposure can regain their original tone.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Reduced tan lines and patches, restoration of the skin\'92s natural color, and a brighter, more even skin tone overall. It essentially \'93erases\'94 the effects of sun exposure when used diligently over a few weeks. (Again, daily sunscreen is a non-negotiable part of detan routine, so this kit emphasizes that.)\'a0
\f2\b Glow Kit (The Sunkissed Secret Kit):
\f3\b0 \'a0A kit curated to give you a quick path to radiant, \'93sunkissed\'94 glowing skin. It often contains the essentials for a dewy complexion: perhaps the\'a0
\f2\b Timeless Skin Face Wash
\f3\b0 \'a0for fresh, clean skin;\'a0
\f2\b Skin Secret Face Serum
\f3\b0 \'a0for a dose of vitamins and mild exfoliation; and the\'a0
\f2\b Resurfacing Face Oil
\f3\b0 \'a0to lock in moisture and impart a healthy glow. Another variant might swap in a light day cream or the sunscreen if it\'92s a daytime glow focus. The idea is to both brighten and nourish the skin so it naturally glows.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Immediately, a hydrated luminous finish (thanks to the face oil); and with continued use, improved tone and texture, and that elusive \'93lit from within\'94 glow. Think of it as a mini-regimen for special events or just maintaining a naturally radiant complexion.\'a0
\f2\b The Ultimate Sally\'92s Soul Therapy Kit:
\f3\b0 \'a0This all-in-one mega kit contains\'a0
\f4\i the entire range of essentials
\f3\i0 \'a0for a complete skin transformation. It\'92s the ultimate collection for someone who wants to invest in their skin fully. The kit generally includes\'a0
\f2\b every major product
\f3\b0 : the cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, all the key serums (brightening serum, acne serum, retinol serum, face oil, eye serum), and one or two of the night creams. Essentially, it\'92s a comprehensive set so that one can mix-and-match a routine for any skin concern or time of day.\'a0
\f2\b Expected Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Because this kit addresses every aspect of skincare \'96 cleansing, hydration, sun protection, acne control, anti-aging, brightening, etc. \'96 it empowers the user to achieve their best skin ever. By using the products in synergy (for example: cleanse \uc0\u8594  treat \u8594  moisturize \u8594  protect in the day; and cleanse \u8594  more intensive treat \u8594  nourish at night), the skin can dramatically improve in all parameters: clarity, smoothness, even tone, firmness, and glow. This kit is often chosen by brides or skincare enthusiasts who want\'a0
\f2\b complete care
\f3\b0 \'a0and the flexibility to target any issue. It truly embodies the brand\'92s holistic approach by providing everything needed for a soulful skin ritual at home.

This service is great for monthly maintenance or for teens and others who want a quick skin refresher without the full indulgence of a facial.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Removes surface dirt and dull dead cells, prevents clogged pores, and instantly brightens the face.\cb1 \

Facials:
\f3\b0 \'a0Sally\'92s Soul Therapy offers a variety of facials, each crafted for specific outcomes (hydrating, brightening, anti-aging, acne-clearing, etc.). Facials are multi-step treatments typically including deep cleansing, exfoliation (often through scrubs or mild fruit acids), massage to boost circulation, and treatment masks loaded with nutrients. For example, a Hydration Facial might use hyaluronic acid-based products, while a Glow Facial may incorporate vitamin C or even a\'a0
\f2\b Carbon Laser Facial
\f3\b0 \'a0(as hinted on social media) for an ultimate rejuvenation{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.instagram.com/sallyssoultherapy/reel/C_S77ZdvlO_/#:~:text=Carbon%20Facial%20Calling%20to%20Sally%27s,your%20skin%27s%20ultimate%20rejuvenation"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 instagram.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Facials deeply nourish the skin, improve blood circulation (giving you a glow), and can be targeted to your skin\'92s needs (e.g., calming sensitive skin or detoxifying congested skin). They are also wonderfully relaxing and considered \'93skincare for the soul\'94 in how they destress you.\cb1 \

Chemical Peels:
\f3\b0 \'a0Professional\'a0
\f2\b peel treatments
\f3\b0 \'a0to resurface the skin. The clinic offers various peels (like glycolic peel, lactic peel, salicylic peel, etc.) depending on the concern. In a peel session, a controlled amount of alpha or beta hydroxy acid is applied to exfoliate the top layers of skin. This helps in treating pigmentation, acne scars, uneven texture, and fine lines by revealing smoother, clearer skin beneath.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Peels can dramatically brighten the complexion, lighten dark spots, reduce blemishes, and even stimulate collagen (with stronger peels). They basically speed up the skin\'92s renewal process. A series of peels can make skin look younger and more even. (These are done by professionals with proper after-care provided, like moisturizing and sun protection guidance, since skin is sensitive post-peel.)\cb1 \

Skin Tightening Treatments:
\f3\b0 \'a0Non-surgical procedures aimed at firming up lax or sagging skin. Sally\'92s Soul Therapy likely uses technologies such as\'a0
\f2\b Radiofrequency (RF) skin tightening
\f3\b0 \'a0or\'a0
\f2\b Ultrasound therapy
\f3\b0 \'a0to heat deeper skin layers, which stimulates collagen production. Another technique could be\'a0
\f2\b Thermage or RF with microneedling
\f3\b0 \'a0for tightening. These treatments are great for someone noticing slight drooping (jowls, slight hooded eyelids, etc.) who isn\'92t ready for surgical options.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Over a few weeks to months after treatment, skin becomes firmer, jawlines a bit sharper, and overall skin elasticity improves. It\'92s essentially a collagen boost, resulting in a more youthful, taut appearance.\cb1 \
\ls7\ilvl0
\f2\b \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
HIFU Facelift:
\f3\b0 \'a0
\f2\b High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)
\f3\b0 \'a0is a cutting-edge facial treatment offered here for lifting and contouring. HIFU penetrates ultrasound energy into specific depths of the skin (including the SMAS layer, which is the layer surgeons target in facelifts) without any incisions. It\'92s known as the \'93lunchtime facelift\'94 because there\'92s no downtime.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0HIFU can help reduce sagging, especially around the cheeks, jawline, and neck, and smooth out wrinkles. It works by tightening the underlying muscles and skin via collagen remodeling. Clients often notice a more defined jaw, lifted brows, or tighter under-chin area a few months after a HIFU session{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.instagram.com/sallyssoultherapy/reel/C9KV0revfYc/#:~:text=WHAT%20IS%20HIFU%3F%20A%20High,review%20for%20Sally%27s%20Soul%20Therapy"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 instagram.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}. It\'92s a one of the more advanced services for anti-aging in the clinic\'92s menu.\cb1 \

\f2\b \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Wrinkle Reduction:
\f3\b0 \'a0This likely refers to treatments specifically targeting fine lines and wrinkles. It may encompass a combination of methods \'96 from injectables (if offered) like Botox for dynamic wrinkles, to laser treatments (such as fractional lasers) that resurface and reduce static wrinkles, to collagen induction therapies (like\'a0
\f2\b Microneedling with PRP
\f3\b0 \'a0perhaps) focused on lines. Since the clinic emphasizes holistic care, they might lean more on devices and topical treatments rather than injectables, but it\'92s possible they have a medical professional for Botox/fillers too. In general, a wrinkle reduction session will soften lines on the forehead, around eyes (crow\'92s feet), laugh lines, etc.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Smoother skin texture and a more youthful look. If non-invasive methods are used (like laser, RF, or peels), you also get improved skin tone and quality along with the wrinkles fading.\cb1 \
\ls7\ilvl0
\f2\b \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Double Chin Treatment:
\f3\b0 \'a0A service to reduce the appearance of a double chin and contour the jawline. This could be done via\'a0
\f2\b fat-dissolving injections
\f3\b0 \'a0(like Kybella, if available, or other lipolysis injections) that gradually melt submental fat. Alternatively,\'a0
\f2\b HIFU
\f3\b0 \'a0or\'a0
\f2\b Radiofrequency
\f3\b0 \'a0might be used here as well, since those can also help tighten under-chin skin and even reduce some fat when used at the right settings. Some clinics also use\'a0
\f2\b coolsculpting (fat freezing)
\f3\b0 \'a0or\'a0
\f2\b ultrasonic lipolysis
\f3\b0 \'a0for double chin.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0A more defined chin and neck profile. Over a few weeks, the area under the chin can appear tighter and less full. Many brides and grooms opt for this to have a sharper profile in photos, for example. It\'92s a non-surgical way to address a common concern.\cb1 \

Dermaplaning:
\f3\b0 \'a0A\'a0
\f4\i manual exfoliation procedure
\f3\i0 \'a0where a trained aesthetician uses a sterile surgical scalpel to gently scrape off the top layer of dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (\'93peach fuzz\'94) from the face{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sallyssoultherapy.com/index.php/dermaplaning/#:~:text=Dermaplaning%20is%20a%20gentle%20exfoliation,and%20debris%20from%20the%20face"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 sallyssoultherapy.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}. It sounds intense but is actually painless and very safe in professional hands. Dermaplaning immediately leaves the skin ultra-smooth and soft.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0By removing that dull top layer and peach fuzz, skin looks brighter and makeup can be applied more flawlessly (no tiny hairs to cake on). It can also help products penetrate better. It\'92s great as a pre-event treatment for an instant glow, and it can be combined with a light peel or facial for enhanced results. There\'92s no downtime \'96 you walk out with a glow. (Just sunscreen afterwards because fresh skin is more sensitive.)\cb1 \

Microneedling:
\f3\b0 \'a0Also known as\'a0
\f4\i Collagen Induction Therapy
\f3\i0 , microneedling involves using a device studded with very fine needles to create tiny punctures in the skin. Sally\'92s Soul Therapy offers this to address acne scars, large pores, fine lines, and overall texture. Those micro-injuries stimulate the skin\'92s repair process, boosting collagen and elastin. Sometimes they apply a serum (like hyaluronic acid or vitamin C or even platelet-rich plasma \'96 PRP \'96 if doing a \'93vampire facial\'94) during the process to enhance penetration and results.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Smoother, firmer skin. Over a series of sessions, microneedling can significantly improve acne scarring, reduce wrinkles, and even diminish hyperpigmentation. Skin often looks a bit red right after, but within a couple days you see a fresh glow. It\'92s a minimally invasive way to get substantial skin remodeling.\cb1 \

Under Eye Treatment:
\f3\b0 \'a0A specialized service focusing on the under-eye area. This may involve gentle\'a0
\f2\b chemical peels for under-eyes
\f3\b0 \'a0(to lighten dark circles),\'a0
\f2\b micro-needling or nano-needling under the eyes
\f3\b0 \'a0to boost collagen (for fine lines or hollows), and/or\'a0
\f2\b mesotherapy
\f3\b0 \'a0where vitamins and brightening agents are very lightly injected into the under-eye skin. The clinic might also use\'a0
\f2\b laser treatments
\f3\b0 \'a0(like a Q-switch laser or fractional laser at low settings) around the eyes to target pigmentation or crepey skin.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Depending on the method, under-eye treatments can brighten dark circles, firm up the under-eye bags, and reduce fine lines. Clients often look more \'93awake\'94 and youthful. The treatment is done carefully given the delicate area, often in a series of sessions for best results.\cb1 \
\ls7\ilvl0
\f2\b \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Q-Switch Laser Treatment:
\f3\b0 \'a0A high-tech laser treatment using a Q-switched laser, which is very effective for pigmentation issues. Sally\'92s Soul Therapy likely uses this laser to perform procedures like the\'a0
\f2\b Carbon Laser Facial (Hollywood peel)
\f3\b0 \'a0and for removing stubborn pigmentation or even tattoos. In a popular treatment, a carbon lotion is applied to the face and the Q-switch laser is passed over \'96 the laser vaporizes the carbon along with dead skin and impurities, cleaning out pores and giving an instant glow. Q-switched lasers are also gold-standard for\'a0
\f4\i melasma
\f3\i0 \'a0and\'a0
\f4\i pigmented spots
\f3\i0 , as well as overall skin brightening (laser toning).\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0Safe for most skin tones, the Q-switch laser can significantly lighten freckles, sun spots, and melasma patches over multiple sessions{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.instagram.com/sallyssoultherapy/p/Cy3aImJoA97/#:~:text=Reveal%20Your%20Timeless%20Glow%20with,and%20refreshing%20let%20your"}}{\fldrslt

\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 facebook.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}. It also helps with acne scars and gives a refreshed complexion. Another benefit: it has no downtime (just mild redness), so it\'92s a popular procedure for those who want quick results with minimal recovery.\cb1 \

Laser Hair Removal:
\f3\b0 \'a0Permanent hair reduction using laser technology. The clinics likely use an advanced\'a0
\f2\b Diode laser
\f3\b0 \'a0or\'a0
\f2\b IPL
\f3\b0 \'a0for hair removal, targeting areas like the face (upperlip, chin), underarms, legs, bikini, etc. The laser emits light that is absorbed by hair follicles, destroying them to inhibit future growth.\'a0
\f2\b Benefits:
\f3\b0 \'a0After a series of sessions, unwanted hair becomes much thinner and grows at a far slower rate \'96 often hair stops growing entirely in many areas. It\'92s a boon for those tired of waxing, threading or shaving. Laser hair removal at Sally\'92s Soul Therapy is done with cooling techniques to minimize discomfort, and it is suitable for both women and men (for example, many men do laser for beard shaping or back hair). It\'92s efficient and over time gives you smooth, hair-free skin.\cb1 \

Holistic Add-ons:
\f3\b0 \'a0In line with the \'93soul therapy\'94 theme, the center may also incorporate holistic wellness into services. This could include\'a0
\f2\b face yoga sessions
\f3\b0 ,\'a0
\f2\b guided meditation during facials
\f3\b0 , or\'a0
\f2\b reiki and crystal therapy
\f3\b0 \'a0for those who want an energy healing aspect. While not explicitly listed, the nurturing atmosphere suggests that even standard treatments are delivered with a relaxing, soulful touch\'97think aroma oils, calming music, and maybe a bit of reflexology during a facial massage. These touches ensure you emerge not just with better skin, but also a lighter spirit.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Each service can be customized. Clients often have a treatment plan \'96 for example, a bride might do a combination of peels, laser toning, and facials over months (a\'a0
\f2\b \'93Bridal Package\'94
\f3\b0 ) to reach her skin goals before the wedding. Sally\'92s Soul Therapy\'92s professionals guide clients through these plans with personal care and expertise.

Oily Skin:

\f4\i Goal:
\f3\i0 \'a0control excess oil and prevent breakouts while maintaining hydration. Use a gentle foaming cleanser (like the Timeless Skin Face Wash with salicylic acid) twice daily to remove oil and impurities. Follow with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer \'96 yes, even oily skin needs moisture to stay balanced (the Epidermal Obsession Moisturizer is great because it hydrates without greasiness and even helps minimize pores{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.in/Sallys-Therapy-Epidermal-Obsession-Moisturiser/dp/B0B2Q5DLF4#:~:text=Obsessed%20with%20flawless%20skin%3F%20Look,Moisturizer%20%E2%80%93%20your%20daily%20dose"}}{\fldrslt

\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 amazon.in\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}). Treat the skin with serums containing Niacinamide or Salicylic Acid to keep pores clear (the Acne Arrest Serum fits well at night). During the day,\'a0
\f2\b never skip sunscreen
\f3\b0 \'a0\'96 choose a matte, non-comedogenic one (like SunShade SPF 50++ which gives UV protection sans shine{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sallyssoultherapy.com/index.php/product/sunshade-spf-50-with-vitamin-c-sunscreen/#:~:text=Product%20Description%3A%C2%A0Ditch%20the%20greasy%20sunscreen,50%2B%2B%20with%20Vitamin%20C%20Sunscreen"}}{\fldrslt

\f4\i Goal:
\f3\i0 \'a0add and lock in moisture at every step. Use a creamy, sulfate-free cleanser or cleansing milk that doesn\'92t foam much, to avoid stripping natural oils. Immediately after cleansing, while skin is still damp, apply a hydrating serum or essence (something with Hyaluronic Acid is ideal). Follow with a rich moisturizer (something with ceramides, shea butter, or the like \'96 for instance, the Bio Placenta Night Cream can be used as a potent night-time moisturizer to deeply nourish). During daytime, use a moisturizer with SPF or layer a sunscreen on top that has moisturizing ingredients (SunShade SPF 50++ is hydrating while protecting{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sallyssoultherapy.com/index.php/product/sunshade-spf-50-with-vitamin-c-sunscreen/#:~:text=Vitamin%20C%2C%20it%20provides%20antioxidant,50%2B%2B%20with%20Vitamin%20C%20Sunscreen"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\b Layering is key

\f4\i occlusives
\f3\i0 \'a0\'96 think of adding a few drops of oil or using a sleeping mask as the last step at night to prevent overnight water loss. Also, avoid very hot water when washing your face; lukewarm is better to not dry out the skin further. Using a humidifier in your room can also help keep skin from drying out, especially in winter.\cb1 \

Sensitive Skin:
\f3\b0 \'a0
\f4\i Goal:
\f3\i0 \'a0calm and protect, avoid triggers. Use only very mild, fragrance-free cleansers (a cleanser for baby skin or a very simple gel with minimal ingredients is good). Do not over-exfoliate \'96 physical scrubs are usually a no for sensitive types; if exfoliation is needed, a very low percentage PHA or lactic acid might be tolerated occasionally, but often just a washcloth is enough exfoliation. Focus on barrier repair: look for moisturizers with ceramides, niacinamide (which also calms redness), and madecassoside or centella asiatica (which is in our Timeless Face Wash and helps soothe{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sallyssoultherapy.com/index.php/product/timeless-skin-foaming-face-wash/#:~:text=Face%20Wash%20is%20the%20perfect,a%20clear%20and%20balanced%20complexion"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 sallyssoultherapy.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}). The Epidermal Obsession Moisturizer is actually suitable since it\'92s lightweight and contains aloe and vitamin E which are soothing{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.in/Sallys-Therapy-Epidermal-Obsession-Moisturiser/dp/B0B2Q5DLF4#:~:text=Ingredients%3A"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 amazon.in\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}. Always patch-test new products on your inner arm or behind ear first. Keep the routine simple: a gentle cleanser, a calming serum (like one with niacinamide or just skip serum if not needed), and a protective moisturizer.\'a0
\f2\b Sun protection
\f3\b0 \'a0is critical because sensitive skin can react badly to sun \'96 use a physical sunscreen (zinc oxide based) if chemical ones sting, or try the SunShade SPF which is formulated to be gentle and has vitamin C and E to protect (test it; it\'92s lightweight and generally non-irritating). Also, watch out for common irritants: avoid products with alcohol, strong fragrances, essential oils, or harsh actives (high concentration acids, retinol unless given by derm in low dose, etc.). Using cool thermal water mists and storing your moisturizer in the fridge for a cooling effect can help when skin feels inflamed.\cb1 \

Combination Skin:
\f3\b0 \'a0
\f4\i Goal:
\f3\i0 \'a0balance the oily and dry areas. Combination skin (often oily T-zone, dry/normal cheeks) can be tricky, but basically you may treat different areas slightly differently. Use a gentle foaming cleanser that cleanses the oily parts but doesn\'92t overdry the cheeks \'96 the Timeless Skin Face Wash is a good candidate since it has a balance of cleansing and soothing{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sallyssoultherapy.com/index.php/product/timeless-skin-foaming-face-wash/#:~:text=Therapy%20Timeless%20Skin%20Foaming%20Face,a%20clear%20and%20balanced%20complexion"}}{\fldrslt

\fs18 \cf4 \cb5 sallyssoultherapy.com\cb1 \uc0\u8232 }}. When moisturizing, you might use a light gel or lotion on the T-zone and a slightly creamier moisturizer on the drier areas. Or use one medium-weight moisturizer all over \'96 Epidermal Obsession Moisturizer could work universally here because it hydrates without heavy oils. For combination skin,\'a0
\f2\b targeted treatments
\f3\b0 \'a0help: for example, you can apply the Acne Arrest Serum just on your oily breakout-prone zones, and a hydrating serum (or none) on the cheeks. Blot the nose and forehead as needed, but you can also apply an additional layer of hydration (like a few drops of face oil or a second coat of moisturizer) to your dry parts. Masks can be multi-masked: a clay mask on the nose/forehead, and a hydrating mask on the cheeks at the same time. Essentially, combo skin benefits from a bit of customization. But overall, sticking to moderate products (not too greasy, not too stripping) across the face usually keeps it in check. And don\'92t forget sunscreen daily for all areas \'96 there are dry-touch sunscreens (like our SunShade) that won\'92t clog the oily bits but still moisturize the dry bits.\cb1 \
